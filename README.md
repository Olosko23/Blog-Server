## Introduction
Brief overview of the project's objectives and technologies used (Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js).

## System Architecture
Illustrate the high-level architecture, including server setup, database schema, and how different components interact.

### Authentication
Explanation of the authentication system using bcrypt for hashing passwords. Implementation details of user sign-up, login, and token-based authentication using JWT.

### Blog Creation
Describe the process of creating blog posts, including handling text content, images, and videos. Mention how data is stored in the database, and how the backend handles uploading and linking multimedia content.

### Comments and Replies
Detail the functionalities for commenting on blog posts and replying to comments. Explain the database schema for comments, associations with blog posts, and threading for replies.

### Data Retrieval
Explain APIs to retrieve all blogs or a single blog based on various criteria (by ID, tags, etc.). Describe pagination or filtering mechanisms for efficient data retrieval.

### Tagging System
Detail how tags are assigned to blogs and how they help categorize content. Explain the implementation of tagging and the schema in the database.

### Recommendation Algorithms
Describe algorithms used for recommending posts based on a user's reading history. Explain how the backend tracks user behavior, analyzes preferences, and suggests relevant content.

### Dependencies
Outline the dependencies (axios, bcrypt, nodemon, dotenv, express, async handler, cors) and their roles in the project. Include version details or specific configurations if necessary.

### Error Handling and Testing
Discuss error handling strategies and how the backend deals with exceptions. Mention any unit tests, integration tests, or tools used for testing APIs and functionalities.

### Scalability and Future Improvements
Address scalability concerns and potential improvements for the future, such as incorporating caching mechanisms or enhancing recommendation algorithms.

## Models
1. **User Model**
    - Properties: _id, username, email, password (hashed), createdAt, updatedAt
    - Relationships: None
2. **Post Model**
    - Properties: _id, title, content, images/videos, tags[], createdAt, updatedAt
    - Relationships: User (author), Comments[]
3. **Comment Model**
    - Properties: _id, text, user (commenter), postId (reference to Post), replies[]
    - Relationships: Post, User (commenter), Replies[]

## Controllers
1. **AuthController**
    - `signup`: Create a new user account
    - `login`: Log in an existing user
2. **PostController**
    - `createPost`: Create a new blog post
    - `getAllPosts`: Retrieve all blog posts
    - `getPostById`: Retrieve a specific blog post by ID
3. **CommentController**
    - `addComment`: Add a comment to a post
    - `addReply`: Add a reply to a comment
    - `getCommentsByPostId`: Get comments for a post
4. **TagController**
    - `getAllTags`: Retrieve all available tags
5. **RecommendationController**
    - `getRecommendations`: Get personalized post recommendations based on user history

## Routes (Express.js)
**Authentication Routes**
- POST `/api/auth/signup`
- POST `/api/auth/login`
**Post Routes**
- POST `/api/posts`
- GET `/api/posts`
- GET `/api/posts/:postId`
**Comment Routes**
- POST `/api/posts/:postId/comments`
- POST `/api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId/replies`
- GET `/api/posts/:postId/comments`
**Tag Routes**
- GET `/api/tags`
**Recommendation Routes**
- GET `/api/recommendations`

### Interaction Flow
1. **Authentication Flow**
    - User signs up or logs in.
    - Upon successful authentication, the user receives a token for subsequent requests.
2. **Post Flow**
    - Authenticated user creates a new blog post.
    - Users retrieve all posts or a specific post.
3. **Comment Flow**
    - Users add comments or replies to specific posts.
    - Retrieve comments for a specific post.
4. **Tag and Recommendation Flow**
    - Retrieve all available tags for categorization.
    - Get personalized recommendations based on user behavior.

## Components
1. **Client Interface**: This is where users interact with your web app. They access blog posts, comment on them, and receive recommendations based on their preferences.
2. **Server (Node.js with Express.js)**:
    - **Routes**: Define the APIs/endpoints allowing users to perform actions like creating posts, commenting, logging in, etc.
    - **Controllers**: Handle the logic behind each route, interacting with models, handling user requests, and sending appropriate responses.
    - **Middleware**: Implement middleware for authentication, error handling, and data validation.
3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
    - **Models**: Represent the structure of your data. User model stores user information, post model handles blog posts, and comment model manages comments and replies.
    - **Data Storage**: MongoDB stores all user data, blog posts, comments, and associated metadata.

## Functionality
1. **Authentication**:
    - Users can sign up for new accounts and log in securely.
    - Token-based authentication ensures secure access to protected routes.
2. **Blog Posts**:
    - Users can create new blog posts with titles, content, images/videos, and tags.
    - Retrieval of all blog posts or specific posts based on criteria (ID, tags, etc.).
3. **Comments and Replies**:
    - Users can comment on blog posts and reply to existing comments.
    - Comments are threaded and associated with specific blog posts.
4. **Tagging System**:
    - Blogs are categorized using tags (e.g., tech, finance) allowing for easy classification and retrieval.
5. **Recommendation Engine**:
    - Analyzes user behavior to suggest posts based on their reading history.
    - Personalized recommendations improve user engagement.

### Flow of Operations
1. **User Interaction**:
    - Users interact with the client interface, accessing various functionalities.
2. **Request Processing**:
    - The server handles incoming requests via defined routes.
    - Controllers manage these requests, executing the required logic.
3. **Data Management**:
    - Data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated in MongoDB through defined models.
4. **Response Delivery**:
    - Responses are sent back to the client interface, providing the necessary data or confirmation of actions performed.

## Key Aspects
1. **Security**:
    - Utilizes bcrypt for password hashing and token-based authentication for secure user access.
2. **Scalability**:
    - Designed to handle increased traffic and data by leveraging MongoDB's scalability features.
3. **Flexibility**:
    - Modular design allows for easy addition of new features or modifications to existing functionalities.
